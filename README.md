# Docker Intro for Java Developers

> Note: Need to fix Dockerfile build to finish.

- [How To: Basic Web App with Gralde](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/#_create_a_simple_web_application)

A simple demonstration of how to dockerize an app, build and run it. This demo is based on the [Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started) tutorial at Docker.

This lesson aims to teach you the basics of Docker and get you familiar with using the tool. There are 5 sections, each with their own exercises for mastery. By the end you should be able to:

- Create images
- Create containers
- Create services (with Virtual Machines)
- Create and manage clusters (Docker Compose)
- Create stacks (Docker Compose)

Clone this repository (or any of the relevant repos below per your instructors guidance). This lesson focuses strictly on Docker, not a given language or framework.

- [Java App]()
- [Javascript App]()

Each repo contains: a single script, an ignore file, a dependencies file (if needed) and a README with these same instructions.
